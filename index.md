# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently following the instructions from GitHub Skills: Communicate using Markdown

## About Markdown
**What is _Markdown_?** Markdown is a [lightweight syntax](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for communicating on GitHub.
You can format text to add a heading, lists, **bold**, _italics_, tables, and many other stylings. You can use Markdown in most places around GitHub:
- Comments on [issues](https://docs.github.com/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues), [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests), and [discussions](https://docs.github.com/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions)
- Files with the `.md` or `.markdown` extension
- Sharing snippets of text in [Gists](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists)

## Basic writing and formatting syntax
You can refer at this [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Example
#### Header
A header is a larger bit of text at the beginning of a section. There are six sizes, from the largest to the smallest, to indicate the level of heading like in HTML `<h1>` - `<h6>`.
