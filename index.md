# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently following the instructions from GitHub Skills: Communicate using Markdown

## About Markdown
**What is _Markdown_?** Markdown is a [lightweight syntax](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for communicating on GitHub.
You can format text to add a heading, lists, **bold**, _italics_, tables, and many other stylings. You can use Markdown in most places around GitHub:
- Comments on [issues](https://docs.github.com/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues), [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests), and [discussions](https://docs.github.com/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions)
- Files with the `.md` or `.markdown` extension
- Sharing snippets of text in [Gists](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists)

## Basic writing and formatting syntax
You can refer at this [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Create sophisticated formatting for your prose and code on GitHub with simple syntax
#### Header
A header is a larger bit of text at the beginning of a section. There are six sizes, from the largest to the smallest, to indicate the level of heading like in HTML `<h1>` - `<h6>`.
To create a heading, add one to six `#` symbols before your heading text. The number of `#` you use will determine the hierarchy level and typeface size of the heading.

#### Images
You can display an image by adding `!` and wrapping the alt text in `[ ]`. Alt text is a short text equivalent of the information in the image. Then, wrap the link for the image in parentheses `()`.
##### Example
![Image of a cute cat](https://images.pexels.com/photos/225406/pexels-photo-225406.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=2)

#### Quoting code
##### Inline code
By using single backtick you can quote inline code like this: `int x = y + z;`
##### Code Blocks
Use triple backticks to quote code blocks:
###### Command-line text example
```
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/skills/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/
```
###### JavaScript code example
``` javascript
var myVar = "Hello, world!";
```

#### Task lists
To create a task list, preface list items with a hyphen and space followed by `[ ]`. To mark a task as complete, use `[x]`.
If a task list item description begins with a parenthesis, you'll need to escape it with `\`:
```
- [ ] \(Optional) Open a followup issue
```
##### Example
- [ ] Turn on GitHub Pages
- [ ] Outline my portfolio
- [ ] Introduce myself to the world

For more information, see "[About task lists](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/about-task-lists)".
